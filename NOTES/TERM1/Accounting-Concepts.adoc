== Accounting Concepts

== Monetry Measurement:
- Allows us to add different items together by assigning monetry value in a common currency (NZD)
- Convert other currencys to common currency to compare.
- Exclude items that can't have a monetry value.

== Accounting Entity:
- Every business's finances are recorded seperately.

== Going Concern:
- The intention that the business will continue to operate into the foreseeable future.
- Buisness will buy things they can use for a long period of time (e.g. a fryer).

== Reporting Period:
- Continuing life of the business is divided into periods of time of equal length.
- Used to understand finances and profits to make decisions.

== Historical Cost:
- Transactions are recorded at the original cost/price paid by the business.
